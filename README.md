The payment ends when the credit is payed in full. • Mr. and Mrs. Smith have problem managing their bills with so many credits to pay recurrently. They have regularly been late on the payments that have hurt their credit score. • In your group, design and implement an application that manages the bills payment that any person like Mr. and Mrs. Smith can use to control their personal bills and keep them up to date. • Such application should store all the information necessary about the creditors and the credits. • The users should be able to see the details report of all their bills like the list of creditors, the amount of credits, the amount of current bills, the due dates, and more... • The application should periodically report to the user as a friendly reminder, via text message or e-mail or both, depending on the setup, all the payments that are close to due date. • The user should be able to update the application whenever there is any change to the credit like payment being processed, opening of new credit, the closing of the credit, etc.
